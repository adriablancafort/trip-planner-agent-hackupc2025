# TripMates - Team Trip Planner AI Agent

## üß© The Challenge

Finding the perfect destination for a group of friends living in different locations can be challenging. We've built a smart travel planner that helps groups easily discover ideal destinations based on everyone's preferences, creating a fun, collaborative experience where every member has input in the final decision.

This project was created for the HackUPC 2025 challenge: **"The Perfect Reunion: Finding the Best Destination for Friends Around the World"**, by SkyScanner.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Talk to our AI trip planner through an interactive interface
- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Input preferences from all group members to find the perfect destination
- **Built in Flight Search**: Integration with Skyscanner API to find the best flight options
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get destination suggestions based on group interests and constraints
- **Real-time Animations**: Engaging interface with responsive visual feedback
- **Live Transcription**: See your conversation with the AI in real-time

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of two main components:

1. **Python Backend**: 
   - Handles the AI agent logic with LiveKit Agents
   - Integrates with Skyscanner API for flight data
   - Processes user preferences and generates travel recommendations

2. **React Frontend**:
   - Provides an interactive voice interface
   - Displays real-time transcriptions and AI responses
   - Shows flight options and destination recommendations
   - Connects to backend via WebSockets for real-time communication
